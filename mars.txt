Wolfman>Dracula Things I like about Mars:
long nights
cold
dry
color of blood
Two moons = problem for wolfman; says it won't be a problem; i don't believe

This is my version:
Bye humidity = good for mummy

This was Dracula's change:
sand = good for mummy

Love lack of population; nevermind
This is Dracula's change
This is Draculas's second change
This is Dracula's third change
This is Dracula's fourth change
